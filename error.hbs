            <p>The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.  A 404 status code does not indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means, that the condition is likely to be permanent.</p>
            <p>A 404 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]</a>).</p>
